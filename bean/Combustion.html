	  <p>Like an engine, the source code is made up of multiple parts and technologies.<br>
		<p></br>
	<p> Source code can be made up of multiple coding languages which can interact with eachother.<br>
		 Most of what we use today is based off of HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
		 <p></br>
		<p>HTML is similar to the parts of an engine. They are all ready to operate, but they need to be configured and structured to work properly together<br>
			<p></br>
			<p>There are other languages which work like an engine body, placing the parts and creating a unified system.
