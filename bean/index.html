	  <p> My metaphor, "Lets Check The Engine", refers to the act of viewing source code to better understand a website and to troubleshoot your own work. <br>
	  

		<p>In the case of a vehicle, we must open the hood to view the engine. <br>
			<p>With a website we must inspect the website to view its code.<br>
	           
				<p> I have found that being able to inspect the code is much more important than being some cool looking trick. <br>
					
					When I was creating an interacive display, I was having some issues that visual studio was not picking up.<br>
					 Going into my live server and inspecting the source code allowed for me to find information on how to fix my issue. 
					 
					 <p>The more I learn about code, the more I feel inclined to view the source code of a website when I find an interesting interaction or visual. 
					Recently I have been able to learn how these processes are done just by looking at the source code. 
					
					<p> This website will elaborate on the metaphor and explain the key components of a source code
